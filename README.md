## Patch v1 Notes

This is the initial launch of HKLT - Recipe. 

## Background info:

This is a project I started for a Software Engineering bootcamp @GeneralAssembly.
HKLT - Recipe is inspired for my current obsession to the Hong Kong native drink.
In dedication to my search for the perfect recipe, I hope you are able to explore and enjoy.

Next Steps:
Icebox from Trello (link above):
The goal is really to nail the best recipe. until then next steps would be user experience i.e. background music for the home page, "add image" section, and hiring a designer to beautify the webpage. After the perfect recipe is crafted, we can start to explore new pages. Starting with the next obsession (viet iced coffee) and a 18+ page for alcoholic drinks possibly. I don't want to lose focus so I want to make sure for now we are hyper obsessed with 1 drink.
